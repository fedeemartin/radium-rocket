        <h3>Peru has opened the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu for a single Japanese tourist who had waited almost seven months to visit the world heritage site.</h3>
        
        <p>Jesse Katayama was due to visit Machu Picchu in March but it closed because of coronavirus.</p>
        <p>Culture Minister Alejandro Neyra said Mr Katayama was granted access after submitting a special request.</p>
        <p>The ancient Inca citadel - Peru's top tourist attraction - is expected to re-open at reduced capacity next month.</p>
        <p>No exact date has been given.</p>
        <p>Mr Katayama planned to spend only a few days in Peru, but became stranded in the town of Aguas Calientes, near Machu Picchu, in mid-March because of coronavirus travel regulations.</p>

        <p>Mr Katayama was permitted to enter the ruins on Saturday with the head of the park "so that he can do this before returning to his country", Mr Neyra said.</p>
        <p>In a video recorded on top of Machu Picchu mountain, the tourist celebrated the long-awaited trip.</p>
        <p>"This tour is truly amazing, thank you," said Mr Katayama.</p>
        <p>Peru has reported more than 849,000 coronavirus cases and 33,000 deaths since the pandemic began, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University.</p>
